# Random Numbers Game

## The Game
Generate a random number between 1-100 and show it to the user
Ask the user to guess whether the next one will be higher or lower
Generate a new random number between 1-100, which cannot be the same as the previous one
If the user is correct give them 1 point
If the user is incorrect the game finishes
When the user reaches 10 points then have completed the game so congratulate them!
When a game finishes give the user the option to play again
Record the top three high scores, including overall time – you’ll need to prompt for a username at some point during the game
Use the time to split equal scores – faster is better
The high scores should be persisted, so they are available every time the game is run
